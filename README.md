# FeelReal

Welcome to **FeelReal** â€“ the app that's more attentive to your wellness than your mother asking if you've eaten yet. If you're ready to dive into a world where your emotional, physical, and dietary health come first, then you're in the right place. **FeelReal** is built using Angular on the frontend, with Spring Boot and Hibernate rocking the backend, all tied together with PostgreSQL for that sweet, sweet data persistence. Oh, and we're shipping the whole thing in Docker because, why not?

**FeelReal** is a digital mental health and wellness platform designed to help you manage your daily wellness through personalized plans and interactive tools.

## Getting Started

Here's how to get the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. That's it! Docker will handle the rest.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krisdimitrov03/FeelReal.git
   cd FeelReal
   ```

2. **Run with Docker:**

   Use Docker Compose to build and run both the frontend and backend services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will set up both the Angular frontend and the Spring Boot backend along with the PostgreSQL database. Everything is containerized for simplicity and consistency.

   The services are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, which includes Docker configurations for each part of our application.

### Using the Application

After running Docker Compose, visit `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to interact with the **FeelReal** platform. Everything you need is running in containers, seamlessly connecting the Angular frontend with the Spring Boot backend.
